    "home/mogumogu_fun": "Nng... It's not fair how you just win them all over with your cooking... And then you back away, acting all bashful. Ah, whatever. Can I have a second?",
    "home/yukisanyashotasanni": "Yuki and Shota are training me on how to use my powers. They told me not to overdo it, but... I'm determined. I won't let anything stop me.",
    "home/shotasanttesa": "Isn't Shota way too... buddy-buddy with Alk? I mean, he betrayed him once and doesn't even act sorry. What? Why are you laughing, Nao?!",
    "home/akogareno": "I want to be more like the people I look up to... But they're who they are, and I'm me. Plus, I really like being coddled by beautiful people.",

    "ally/join": "I'm Luca. I'm happy to see you again, but... I just wish I was coolerâ€”ah, nevermind, forget it. I'm glad to be part of your team!",
    "ally/evolution": "Heh. How about it? Don't I look a bit cooler than before? I'm going to get even stronger, so keep your eyes on me, all right?"
