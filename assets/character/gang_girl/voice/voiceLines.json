    "home/orewa": "I'm Stella's bodyguard. Where she goes, I go. I'd follow her to the ends of the earth. But another world? Didn't see that one coming.",
    "home/meikyuuno": "To think I'd be, not just a Kaleidoscope adventurer, but one in another world! Heh heh. If only I could go back and tell my kid self, \"Hey, check this out! Can you believe it?!\"",
