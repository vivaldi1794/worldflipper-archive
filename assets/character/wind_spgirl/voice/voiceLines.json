    "home/chikagorowa": "I've been sparring with some other people recently... Would you like to know who?\nWell, too bad, Sir Alk. It's a secret.",
    "home/konokenniwa": "This blade is the pride of Tris.\n...It's odd. I all but cut ties with my family, but thinking of them... still brings me strength.",
    "home/udewo": "A swordfight... That's a far better way to get to know someone than socializing. With each blade clash, you can just hear the thrumming of your hearts.",
    "ally/join": "I am Celtie Tris, of the Farlands. What say we spar sometime? I think you'll find I'm quite handy with a sword.",
    "ally/evolution": "I, Celtie of the House of Tris, swear upon my sword to guard and keep Starview Village... \nI'll be the Knight of Stars. Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?"
