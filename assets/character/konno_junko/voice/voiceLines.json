    "home/zombinotsugiwa": "First I get turned into a zombie, and now I'm in another Saga... I hope we can find a way to get back home.",
    "home/kochiranosagani": "I'm worried we might not be able to return to our Saga. There were many things in my old world that I wasn't used to, but this is on another level.",
    "home/fuanwaarimasuga": "I'm nervous, but there's no use fretting about it all the time. I need to learn from Ai-san and keep practicing my skills to get even better.",
    "home/maenikurabetara": "I think I'm starting to get used to this Saga. Performing as an idol with everyone is so much fun that I'm starting to forget all my worries.",

    "home/konomae": "I went out with Ai-san a while ago and looked at all the strange clothing available in this Saga. Do you have any outfit recommendations?",
    "ally/join": "I'm Zombie Number 4, Junko Konno. I'm honestly at a loss for what to do, but I'm going to try my best. It's nice to meet you!",
    "ally/evolution": "I'm still not sure what I should do next, but in the meantime, I'll continue singing and dancing for everyone!"
