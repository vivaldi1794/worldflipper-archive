    "home/hee": "Whoa, so those floaty things are other worlds? That's nuts! Wait... Could my weapons be from another world, too? So that's why they look so weird!",
    "home/migiwa": "In my right hand is Drake Buster! In my left is Demon Slayer! Or, wait. Was it the other way around? Whatever! Pretty cool either way, right?",
    "home/mayottayoki": "When you're lost, down, or don't know what to do... that's the perfect time for dungeon diving! Who knows what treasures we'll find! Let's go, go, goooo!",
    "home/nimotsumochishika": "Without my guns, I'd still be a pack mule. It was wrong to even consider using other weapons. Drakey, Deemy, from now on, we're a team!",

    "ally/join": "The name's Kannon—Copperhead Kannon. Huh? You've never heard of me?! No way! I'm kind of a big deal! Well, you know me now. Glad to meetcha!",
